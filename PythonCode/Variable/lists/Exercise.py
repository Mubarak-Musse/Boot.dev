"""
Complete the split_players_into_teams function.

It accepts a list of players (strings representing their names) and returns two lists in this order:

1. A new list of all the players with even-numbered indexes in the original list.
2. A new list of all the players with odd-numbered indexes in the original list.

Use a slice with a "step" to create two new lists from the players list. Don't be afraid to consult your spellbook for list slicing help!
